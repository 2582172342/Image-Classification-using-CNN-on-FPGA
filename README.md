# Image-Classification-using-CNN-on-FPGA
Project is about designing a Trained Neural n/w (CIFAR-10 dataset) on FPGA to classify an Image I/P using deep-learning concept(CNN- Convolutional Neural Network).

There are 6 Layers(Sliding Window Convolution, ReLU Activation, Max Pooling, Flattening, Fully Connected and Softmax Activation) which decides the class of our I/P Image. Kernels/Filters are used for feature detection from an Image I/P. Image I/P can be a Greyscale/Colored one.
